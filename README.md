## What's this?

Gary is the friend you never had whilst programming CLI tools. He tries to help you out whenever, wherever you need help.

How? He's got a skillset. A very particular skillset that makes him the best at what he does; parsing commandline arguments/flags.

## But, why?

Well, I personally always used Go's flag package but found that it lacked some features such as;

- Accepting anonymous arguments; Well, it does, but it makes it harder than it should.

**Example:** You want your tool to accept actions as the first argument;

```
./<tool> <action> <other params>

./foo firelazers --colour red
```

And to learn!

## I'd like to contribute to this!

I was hoping you'd say that. Feel free to fork this project and send any PR's. **Please don't forget to create an issue with a detailed description for what you'll be building!**

## There's no license!

Nope, haven't thought of which one to use yet. Feel free to send suggestions though!
